**Python Drupal Services** is a little module that lets you use Drupal Services in Python.

It's loosely based on several pieces of code found elsewhere:

* http://drupal.org/project/Python_Services
* http://www.speakingx.com/blog/2008/11/21/testing-out-drupals-service-module-using-python
* http://drupal.org/node/308629


It has not been maintained for many years.
