**Python Drupal Services** is a little module that lets you use Drupal Services in Python.

It's loosely based on several pieces of code found elsewhere:

* http://drupal.org/project/Python_Services
* http://www.speakingx.com/blog/2008/11/21/testing-out-drupals-service-module-using-python
* http://drupal.org/node/308629


[Kasper Souren](http://guaka.org/) wrote this a while ago. It's not really been maintained 
for a while but if there's any interest Kasper might get back to this, for a cool project and/or for money.
